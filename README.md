# Ballerina: Cloud Native Middleware as a Programming Language

[Ballerina](http://ballerina.io) is a programming language for the cloud-era; specializing in creating network connected applications. It brings together the higher level abstractions of middleware technologies, but with the flexibility of a general-purpose programming language. 

In this workshop, we will take a look at full end-to-end development of a microservices architecture with Ballerina. This is split into four main parts. 

## Part 1: Introduction to the Ballerina language
- Type system
- Network abstractions
- Visualizing the code: sequence diagrams
- Concurrency
- Secure-by-default: taint analysis
- Language Integrated Query

## Part 2: Network Awareness
- HTTP/S features/functionality
- Resiliency
- gRPC
- NATS
- WebSockets

## Part 3: Observability
- Metrics – Integrating with Prometheus
- Distributed Tracing – OpenTracing

## Part 4: Deployment
- Docker/Kubernetes/KNative
- AWS Lambda
- GitHub Actions
