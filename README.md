# Ballerina: Cloud-Native Middleware as a Programming Language

[Ballerina](http://ballerina.io) is a programming language for the cloud-era; specializing in creating network connected applications. It brings together the higher level abstractions of middleware technologies, along with the flexibility of a general-purpose programming language. 

In this workshop, we will take a look at how the Ballerina platform can be used effectively in creating microservices architectures. This is split into four main parts. 

## Part 1: Introduction to the Ballerina Language
- Type system
- Functions
- Flow control
- Concurrency
- Visualizing the code: sequence diagrams
- Secure-by-default: taint analysis
- Language Integrated Query
- Java Interop

## Part 2: Network Awareness
- Network abstractions
  - Services/listeners/clients
  - Resources
  - Remote methods
- Programming Model
  - Non-blocking I/O
  - Resiliency
- Protocols
  - HTTP/S
  - gRPC
  - WebSockets

## Part 3: Observability
- Metrics – Integrating with Prometheus
- Distributed Tracing – OpenTracing

## Part 4: Deployment
- Docker/Kubernetes
- AWS Lambda
- GitHub Actions

### Workshop Duration and Audience
The workshop is designed to be finished in 2.5 hrs. The general audience consists of developers and architects. Basic programming knowledge in any language is required. 

## Prerequisites
